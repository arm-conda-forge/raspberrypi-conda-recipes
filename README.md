About
-----
A repository of conda recipes for the RaspberryPi. All build distributions are available on binstar at:

https://anaconda.org/RaspberryPi

If you already have conda installed on the RaspberryPi (via the miniconda installer or otherwise), simply add the
raspberrypi channel and run ``conda update --all``.

Installing conda on the RaspberryPi
-----------------------------------
Currently there is an old-ish Miniconda installer for the RaspberryPi at http://repo.continuum.io/miniconda/Miniconda-3.5.5-Linux-armv6l.sh.
A more up to date self extracting installer will be made available in due course (in this repo).
